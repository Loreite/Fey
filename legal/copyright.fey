    [Format] Fey Copyright Format 0.1
    This format is based on the Debian copyright format, version 1.0.
    https://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/copyright-format/1.0/

    The key difference is the use of the Fey laguage syntax.

    Exhaustive licensing information for files in the Fey repository

    I. Purpose

    This file aims at documenting the copyright and license for every source
    file in the Fey repository, and especially outline the files
    whose license differs from the MIT/Expat license used by Fey.


    II. Format

    It is written as a machine-readable format loosely following the debian/copyright
    specification, with variations in syntax base don the Fey language.


    II.i. Patterns

    Globbing patterns (e.g. "Files: *") mean that they affect all corresponding files
    (also recursively in subfolders), apart from those with a more explicit copyright statement.


    III. Licensing

    Licenses are given with their debian/copyright short name
    (or SPDX identifier if no standard short name exists)
    and are all included in plain text at the end of this file (in alphabetical order).


    IV. Disclaimer

    IV.i. Thirdparty libraries

    Licensing details for thirdparty libraries in the 'external/' directory
    are given in summarized form, i.e. with only the "main" license described
    in the library's license statement. Different licenses of single files or
    code snippets in thirdparty libraries are not documented here.

    [Example]
        Files: external/zlib/*
        Comment: Additional notes and/or details
        Copyright: 1995-2017, Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler
        License: Zlib

    The exact copyright for each file in that library *may* differ, and some
    files or code snippets might be distributed under other compatible licenses
    (e.g. a public domain dedication), but as far as Fey is concerned
    such a library is considered as a whole under the Zlib license.
